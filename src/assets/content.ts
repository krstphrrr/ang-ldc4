        "description":"The Landscape Data Commons is an inter-agency monitoring data repository and portal, led by the USDA-ARS at the Jornada Experimental Range, that connects standardized monitoring data to analysis tools to support land management and research. The Landscape Data Commons aggregates core methods data collected across agencies and monitoring programs (e.g., AIM, NRI, the National Wind Erosion Research Network, smaller research and monitoring efforts). With these aggregated data, the Landscape Data Commons supports natural resource management, modeling, and research. The Landscape Data Commons provides consistent indicator calculations and distributions of indicators by classification unit (e.g., ecological site), connects these data to wind and water erosion models (e.g., AERO and RHEM),  remote sensing models (e.g., RAP), and decision support tools (e.g., the Land Treatment Exploration Tool, the Ecological Dynamics Interpretive Tool).",

AIM data are collected through a combination of probabilistic surveys and target sampling at national, regional, and project scales. Terrestrial AIM data include line-point intercept, gap intercept, vegetation height, and species inventory. Many plots also contain soil stability values and 70 cm soil pits.

The network uses standardized sensors to measure aeolian sediment transport rates, dust deposition, dust concentrations and dust emission, and collects line-point intercept, vegetation height and gap intercept methods for soil surface and vegetation properties. Vegetation monitoring methods and models used by the network are consistent with those used by BLM AIM and NRCS NRI (<a href=\"https://winderosionnetwork.org\">https://winderosionnetwork.org</a>)."
