The cover, distribution and height of vegetation and other non-erodible roughness elements determine their effectiveness in reducing wind erosion. The transect design enables detailed directional estimates of the fractional vegetation cover, vegetation canopy gap-size distribution and canopy height to be acquired in an efficient way that can be related to the meteorological tower measurements of aerodynamic roughness height (z0) and horizontal sediment mass flux from the MWAC samplers.

        "purpose":"Measurements of the vegetation canopy height should be made with the LPI measurements to describe the height of the plant community or crop. The aim of this approach is to be able to describe in detail the roughness characteristics of the site, providing a basis for the model to account for multiple roughness layers (i.e., trees, shrubs, grasses and oriented soil ridges).",
        "supplinf":"Transects should be used to measure the cover, distribution and height of vegetation and non-erodible roughness. The transect design should be based on the following methods: -Vegetation sampling should be conducted on three (3) 100 m transects at both cropland and rangeland sites. -The transects should follow bearings of 0°, 60° and 120°, intersecting at the center of the site (cropland sites; Figure 9) or at the meteorological tower (rangeland sites; Figure 10). -It is acceptable and not an issue if a whole transect falls in a row interspace at cropland sites. This will provide information required for model development. -Measurements along the transects will be treated as repeated measures. Where practical (e.g., rangeland sites), transect start and end points should be marked with rebar stakes to ensure that transect lines are in exactly the same place during each measurement. Markers on field boundaries may be used at cropland sites. -Canopy height should be recorded as the maximum height of any vegetation element (leaf or stem) located within a 15 cm radius every 2 m along the transects. -If no vegetation is present then height is recorded as zero.

        "abstract":"Measurements of soil biological crust cover and rock cover are captured in the Line Point Intercept (LPI) method. The Line-point intercept method can be used to quantify invasive species cover changes where the species is a significant component of the plant community (generally greater than five percent cover). Line-point intercept cover and composition indicators also often reflect the resistance of a site to invasive species establishment. The transect design enables detailed directional estimates of the fractional vegetation cover, vegetation canopy gap-size distribution and canopy height to be acquired in an efficient way that can be related to the meteorological tower measurements of aerodynamic roughness height (z0) and horizontal sediment mass flux from the MWAC samplers.

        "purpose":"Line-point intercept (LPI) provides data that can be used to calculate plant cover and composition indicators, including the percentage bare ground, foliar and basal cover by species and plant functional or structural groups.",
        "supplinf":"LPI measurements should be made at a sampling interval of 25 cm. This will ensure consistency in the measurements and ability to detect cover types at both cropland and rangeland sites. -Vegetation types should be recorded using the USDA plant codes, which can be found at: https://plants.sc.egov.usda.gov/java/ -Specimens of unknown plants should be kept for later identification. -The following soil surface codes should be used: rock fragment sizes: FG: 2-5mm, GR:&gt;5-76mm, CB:76-250mm, ST:250-600mm; BR (bedrock), LC (lichen crust), CY (cyanobacteria crust), D (duff), AG (soil aggregates/clods, &gt;2mm), LM (loose erodible soil, &lt;2mm), PC (physically crusted soil), EL (embedded litter), M (moss). -Note that AG, LM, and PC soil surface codes and DN/S (dung), AM (animal material, unattached) and HT (human trash) in the mid-layer codes are not specified in the Monitoring Manual, but should be used here. -Vegetation sampling should be conducted on three (3) 100 m transects at both cropland and rangeland sites. -The transects should follow bearings of 0°, 60° and 120°, intersecting at the center of the site (cropland sites; Figure 9) or at the meteorological tower (rangeland sites; Figure 10). -Data points for LPI falling on the concrete tower base should be recorded as “PADD” on the data recording sheets in the Top, Soil Surface, and Height columns. The concrete start and end distances should be recorded as PADD start and PADD end on top of the Gap recording sheet. -It is acceptable and not an issue if a whole transect falls in a row interspace at cropland sites. This will provide information required for model development. -Measurements along the transects will be treated as repeated measures. Where practical (e.g., rangeland sites), transect start and end points should be marked with rebar stakes to ensure that transect lines are in exactly the same place during each measurement. Markers on field boundaries may be used at cropland sites.

The percentage of the surface samples tested that are equal to 6 (very stable) is another useful indicator that is easy to calculate. Both are correlated with all three ecosystem attributes. Higher stability has been directly correlated with reductions in erosion. Reference(s): Herrick, J.E., J. Van Zee, S.E. McCord, J.W. Karl, E. Courtright, and L. Burkett. 2018.

These are the processes that glue soil particles together. Soil stability at different depths and under different types of vegetation can be used to reflect changes in organic matter cycling."
