        "abstract":"Vegetation and non-erodible roughness (e.g., rocks) protect the soil surface. The cover, distribution and height of vegetation and other non-erodible roughness elements determine their effectiveness in reducing wind erosion. The transect design enables detailed directional estimates of the fractional vegetation cover, vegetation canopy gap-size distribution and canopy height to be acquired in an efficient way that can be related to the meteorological tower measurements of aerodynamic roughness height (z0) and horizontal sediment mass flux from the MWAC samplers.

        "purpose":"Measurements of the vegetation canopy height should be made with the LPI measurements to describe the height of the plant community or crop. The aim of this approach is to be able to describe in detail the roughness characteristics of the site, providing a basis for the model to account for multiple roughness layers (i.e., trees, shrubs, grasses and oriented soil ridges).",
        "supplinf":"Transects should be used to measure the cover, distribution and height of vegetation and non-erodible roughness. The transect design should be based on the following methods: -Vegetation sampling should be conducted on three (3) 100 m transects at both cropland and rangeland sites. -The transects should follow bearings of 0°, 60° and 120°, intersecting at the center of the site (cropland sites; Figure 9) or at the meteorological tower (rangeland sites; Figure 10). -It is acceptable and not an issue if a whole transect falls in a row interspace at cropland sites. This will provide information required for model development. -Measurements along the transects will be treated as repeated measures. Where practical (e.g., rangeland sites), transect start and end points should be marked with rebar stakes to ensure that transect lines are in exactly the same place during each measurement. Markers on field boundaries may be used at cropland sites. -Canopy height should be recorded as the maximum height of any vegetation element (leaf or stem) located within a 15 cm radius every 2 m along the transects. -If no vegetation is present then height is recorded as zero.
